The MWWorksAuthorsCurrentMarkup3.xml is the reference document for the
Cologne digitization of the List of Works of the Monier Williams Sanskrit English
Dictionary of 1899.  It was prepared under the supervision of 
Peter Scharf and Malcolm Hyman of [The Sanskrit Library](www.sanskritlibrary.org) ca. 2010.

This xml document follows the structure as specified in the Relax NG schema mw-authorities.rng; which, I think, is derived from the compact syntax form of mw-authorities.rnc.

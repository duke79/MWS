### list02php

This is a simple application to access the Cologne dictionaries.
To use it, install this in a php web server.  For instance, set up XAMPP
on your local computer, start the Apache server, then point the 
browser to index.php.

The program makes calls to a development version of an API at the Cologne
server and returns data into an iframe.

As of this revision, the program does NOT work properly with a 'div' instead
of an 'iframe'.
